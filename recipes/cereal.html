    <h2>Cereal: The breakfast that is often surreal</h2>
        <p>Cereal. It's dried grains and sugars in a bowl of milk. Or is it milk with dried
            grains and sugars in it? This question can never be definitively answered, because
            of the simple fact that the truth is still out there. I prefer my cereal with orange
            juice. That is alright.
        </p>
        <p>The simple story put forth by Big Grain that cereal just appeared one day, as if 
            an angry god reached from the heavens saying to eat 3 square meals a day. This is a lie.
            God did give us cereal, but it was meant to be consumed at any time of day, not just for 
            breakfast. I am here to spread enlightenment and freedom from breakfasts tyranical structure.
