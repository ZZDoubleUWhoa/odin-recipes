    <h2>Bratwurst: The best or the <em>wurst?</em></h2>
    
        <p>Bratwurst are a tasty treat for any summers day. Consisting of a pigs leftover parts
            ground into a fine paste, the inside of a bratwurst is heavily seasoned to mask it's
            unsettling origin. This seasoned paste is then inserted into the dried intestine of a,
            you guessed it, pig. The bratwurst is a masterclass in waste not, want not. It is no 
            wonder then that it endures in popularity through time.
        </p>
        <p>Today we will discuss the proper method for cooking a bratwurst, or brat as they're known
            by those in the biz. It is a common misconception that the bratwurst is a ready-made food
            item that can simply be put on a hot grill. The truth is much deeper than that. Fortunately,
            I have done this a few times and can share my wisdom in cooking these intestinal wonders.
